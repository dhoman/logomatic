# Logomatic

This is an example of generating a large number of logo-like shapes
using a simple generative system with a few tunable parameters. It is
live as a web app at
[http://proscenium.rusher.com/logomatic/](http://proscenium.rusher.com/logomatic/).

## Development workflow

Run `lein figwheel` in your terminal. Wait for a while until you see `Successfully compiled "resources/public/js/main.js"`. Open [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449) in your browser.

You can use this while developing your sketch. Whenever you save your source files the browser will automatically refresh everything, providing you with quick feedback. For more information about Figwheel, check the [Figwheel repository on GitHub](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel).
